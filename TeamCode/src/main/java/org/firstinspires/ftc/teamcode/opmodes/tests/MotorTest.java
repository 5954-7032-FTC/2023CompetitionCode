/**
 *  This file illustrates the concept of driving an autonomous path based on Gyro heading and encoder counts.
 *  The code is structured as a LinearOpMode
 *
 *  The path to be followed by the robot is built from a series of drive, turn or pause steps.
 *  Each step on the path is defined by a single function call, and these can be strung together in any order.
 *
 *  The code REQUIRES that you have encoders on the drive motors, otherwise you should use: RobotAutoDriveByTime;
 *
 *  This code ALSO requires that you have a BOSCH BNO055 IMU, otherwise you would use: RobotAutoDriveByEncoder;
 *  This IMU is found in REV Control/Expansion Hubs shipped prior to July 2022, and possibly also on later models.
 *  To run as written, the Control/Expansion hub should be mounted horizontally on a flat part of the robot chassis.
 *
 *  This sample requires that the drive Motors have been configured with names : left_drive and right_drive.
 *  It also requires that a positive power command moves both motors forward, and causes the encoders to count UP.
 *  So please verify that both of your motors move the robot forward on the first move.  If not, make the required correction.
 *  See the beginning of runOpMode() to set the FORWARD/REVERSE option for each motor.
 *
 *  This code uses RUN_TO_POSITION mode for driving straight, and RUN_USING_ENCODER mode for turning and holding.
 *  Note: You must call setTargetPosition() at least once before switching to RUN_TO_POSITION mode.
 *
 *  Notes:
 *
 *  All angles are referenced to the coordinate-frame that is set whenever resetHeading() is called.
 *  In this sample, the heading is reset when the Start button is touched on the Driver station.
 *  Note: It would be possible to reset the heading after each move, but this would accumulate steering errors.
 *
 *  The angle of movement/rotation is assumed to be a standardized rotation around the robot Z axis,
 *  which means that a Positive rotation is Counter Clockwise, looking down on the field.
 *  This is consistent with the FTC field coordinate conventions set out in the document:
 *  ftc_app\doc\tutorial\FTC_FieldCoordinateSystemDefinition.pdf
 *
 *  Control Approach.
 *
 *  To reach, or maintain a required heading, this code implements a basic Proportional Controller where:
 *
 *      Steering power = Heading Error * Proportional Gain.
 *
 *      "Heading Error" is calculated by taking the difference between the desired heading and the actual heading,
 *      and then "normalizing" it by converting it to a value in the +/- 180 degree range.
 *
 *      "Proportional Gain" is a constant that YOU choose to set the "strength" of the steering response.
 *
 *  Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your "TeamCode" folder with a new name.
 *  Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this OpMode to the Driver Station OpMode list
